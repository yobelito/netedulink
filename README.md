# 🚀 Rural Web Caching & Optimization System

### **Bridging the Digital Divide for Rural Schools**
This project provides an **optimized web caching and content delivery solution** for **rural schools with limited Internet access**. By leveraging **Squid Proxy caching and AI-based content prediction**, it reduces bandwidth consumption and improves access to educational materials even in **low-connectivity environments**.

---

## 📌 **Features**
✅ **Reverse Proxy & Caching:** Uses **Squid Proxy** to store and serve frequently accessed content locally.  
✅ **AI-Powered Content Prediction:** Pre-fetches and caches **educational resources, videos, and documents** based on usage trends.  
✅ **Offline Access:** Schools can access cached content even **without an active Internet connection**.  
✅ **Monitoring Dashboard:** Tracks usage metrics, bandwidth savings, and cache efficiency.  
✅ **Cross-Platform Support:** Works with **Windows, Linux, and macOS** environments.  
✅ **Scalable Architecture:** Deployable at a **municipal or school level** to optimize content delivery.

## 🔧 **Requirements**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (latest version)
- **Linux/macOS/Windows** with WSL2 support (for Windows)
- **Python** (for future AI-based content optimization)
- **Basic Networking Knowledge** (for Squid configuration)

---

## 🚀 **Installation & Setup**
### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rural-web-cache.git
cd rural-web-cache
```

### 2️⃣ **Run the Docker Containers**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3️⃣ **Check Squid Proxy Logs**
```bash
docker logs -f squid-cache
```

### 4️⃣ **Test the Proxy**
Set up a browser or system proxy:
- **HTTP Proxy:** `http://localhost:3128`
- **HTTPS Proxy:** `http://localhost:3129`

Then, test with:
```bash
curl -x http://localhost:3128 -I https://www.google.com
```

### 5️⃣ **Access the Monitoring Dashboard**
Visit `http://localhost:8090` to analyze traffic logs.

---

## 🛠 **Configuration**
To modify **Squid's behavior**, edit the `squid.conf` file:
```bash
nano config/squid.conf
```
Then restart Squid:
```bash
docker-compose restart squid
```

---

## 🔍 **Monitoring & Logs**
View access logs:
```bash
docker exec -it squid-cache tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
```
View cache logs:
```bash
docker exec -it squid-cache tail -f /var/log/squid/store.log
```

---

## ❗ **Troubleshooting**
### **Squid doesn't start?**
```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### **Logs show "Permission Denied"?**
Run:
```bash
docker exec -it squid-cache chmod -R 777 /var/spool/squid /var/log/squid
docker-compose restart squid
```
